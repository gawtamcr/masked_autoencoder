        "In this practial exercise, you are going to implement the famous SimCLR [1] algorithm for self-supervised learning. While not that old, it is often seen as the 'classic' approach to contrastive learning and it is still used as a baseline against which newer approaches are compared. Most of the more recent algorithms are just slight alterations of this approach, so knowing how it works will pay off in the future. Due to the growing amounts of data, self-supervised learning is likely to become more and more relevant in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or as Yan LeCun and Ishan Misra put it: SSL may be helpful to unlock the [dark matter of intelligence](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/self-supervised-learning-the-dark-matter-of-intelligence/).\n",

        "## Getting labels is expensive and can be ethically difficult\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular supervised learning requires each data point to be labeled with ground truth information. Additionally, it requires large amounts of data. This unfortunately means that humans have to spend a lot of time hand-labeling data before we can train our networks. If determining the ground truth requires expert knowledge (e.g. diagnosing a disease based on a brain scan), getting large amounts of data is very expensive and time-consuming. In other cases, it can be very repetitive, mind-numbing work: \"Click all images containing traffic lights.\" Since nobody wants to do this kind of work, it is often outsourced to crowd-workers who earn very little and have generally bad working conditions:\n",
        "https://thegoodai.co/2021/02/03/who-is-labeling-your-data/\n",
        "\n",
        "## SSL is a form of pretraining\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-supervised learning now takes a bit of a different approach than supervised learning. It simply outsources the labeling to the computer! The computer *supervises itself*.\n",
        "\n",
        "We first pretrain our model on a so-called *pretext task* using a large **unlabeled** dataset, then fine-tune it on a smaller, labeled dataset. The pretext tasks often consist of supervised learning, but use labels that the computer can automatically generate for any image. Afterwards, we finetune our model using regular supervised learning on a smaller dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "One example for a pretext task would be to rotate the input image and let the network predict the degree of rotation. There's no need for human labeling, since the program has the information about how it rotated the image, so it can use that as a label right away. To solve the task, the network needs to learn e.g. that the sky is usually at the top of the image and that cars have their wheels on the bottom of the image. So it is forced to learn to recognise what the image contains, which is probably useful for the downstream task!"
